# Mod-4-Project: NFL Offseason Tracker
Missing sports as much as I am? (this was made during Coronavirus Quarantine 2020). If you're even the slightest bit interested in all of the activity going on in the NFL this offseason, check out NFL Offseason Tracker!

## Overview
This repo contains both the frontend and backend for NFL Offseason Tracker, an app designed to keep track of and analyze movement of players between NFL teams during the offseason. If you're into football, and especially fantasy football, you're probably used to seeing some unfamiliar names on your team at the beginning of every season. Keeping track of every signing, trade, and release involves looking at a lot of info from a few different sources and trying to obtain insights as a result of combining all of this research. NFL Offseason tracker takes the info from these various sources and creates a visual aid for keeping track of movement between teams as well as looking at details for a specific team.
